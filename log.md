# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 20, 2023 
##### (first day of challenge)

**Today's Progress**: I wrote first pet project with knouckout.js.

**Thoughts:** I wrote it to defend my university presentation, I think it's a very fun framework, but I won't continue writing code in this framework because I'm currently learning React.js. Tomorrow I will start a new chapter of the “hooks” course in udemy.
